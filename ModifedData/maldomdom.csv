After wandering the island for a day, they come across a group of natives. Luckily, one of the natives could speak their language, and offers the survivors a challenge. 

""First, search our land and retrieve ten fruit. Return to my hut by sunset tomorrow with the fruit, and be prepared for the second task. Upon completing this rite of passage, we will give you a boat and supplies to leave our island and return to your mainland. But upon failure, you will be beheaded."" 

The survivors agree that they must accept their rite of passage.

&amp;#x200B;

The first man, Chris, remembered seeing some berries by a river, and retrieved his fruit. 

The second man, Mark, remembered that he had a box of raisins on the flight. After scouring the wreckage, he found his luggage, and retrieved his fruit.

The third man, Jerry, had the hardest time finding any fruit. As the sun was lowering on the next day, he decided to risk it and steal some fruit from the villagers.

&amp;#x200B;

Chris and Mark arrived to the native's hut together with their fruit.

""Now that you have gathered your fruit, you are ready for the second task: You must silently insert all ten of your ten fruit up your butt. If you make any noise, or cannot complete the task, than you will be beheaded.""

Anxious to be over with it, Chris went first. On the 7th berry, he let out a grunt, and the villagers beheaded him.

After collecting himself, Mark starts with his raisins. Mark was handling this with a breeze, until on his 9th raisin, he bursts out laughing. He is beheaded as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Chris finds Mark at the Pearly Gates of Heaven, and asks him: ""How the heck did you fail? You could have fit the whole box up there and still made it home safely!""

Mark replied, still giggling. ""I... I couldn't help myself. Jerry was walking back with 10 pineapples!"""

""Go stand at the periscope entry-way, and make sure no unauthorized personnel touch the periscope.""

The recruit follows orders, and stands by the periscope. After 15 minutes, the officer stops by.

""Son I'm changing your post to the mess hall. Go in there and start washing some dishes.""

The recruit obeys, and heads to the mess hall. He's cleaned about 3 dishes when the officer walks up again.

""Listen here recruit, your new post is in the supply room. I need you to make sure everything is strapped down tight, in case of rough waters.""

The recruit again follows orders, and heads off to the supply room. There, he sees a crewman, moving some boxes.

""Hey there,"" says the recruit. ""is it normal to keep getting reassigned to new posts all day? I haven't kept one position for more than 15 minutes!""

The crewman says ""Oh yeah- this sub is full of reposts."""

5,8543,8543,5,0.5721,"change, light, watch, thing, write, today, bathroom, make, smell, short","To all the mathematicians In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma σ or the Latin letter s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

The standard deviation of a random variable, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically simpler, though in practice less robust, than the average absolute deviation. A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data. There are also other measures of deviation from the norm, including average absolute deviation, which provide different mathematical properties from standard deviation.

In addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions. For example, the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the ""standard error"" of the estimate or ""standard error of the mean"" when referring to a mean. It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed.

It is very important to note that the standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population (such as the mean) are quite different but related (related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviation—the half-width of a 95 percent confidence interval.

In science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall much farther than two standard deviations away from what would have been expected are considered statistically significant—normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations. The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investment.

When only a sample of data from a population is available, the term standard deviation of the sample or sample standard deviation can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (the standard deviation of the entire population).

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, David, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So David and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

""David! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, David's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells David that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" David says.

""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" David says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

At the White House, Trump spots David on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting the Governor, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up, you know I don't give a shit about the Governor.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House he expresses his doubts to David, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says David. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

David and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when David says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later David emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time David returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, David asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with David?'"
7,45113,45113,7,0.6812,"found, happen, train, captain, grandpa, chair, pirate, asshole, smoke, prostitute","There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living. 
He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

(Notes from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:)

Recently I was honored to be selected as a judge at a Chili cook-off, because no one else wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

____

CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.

JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.

FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.

____

CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.

JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face. Sally, the barmaid, seems to like standing behind me when I burn out another fart. She's kind of a kinky one.

____

CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.

JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.

FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.

____

CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC

JUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.

JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.

FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.

____

CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.

JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !

____

CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.

JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.

FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

____

CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.

FRANK: You could put a #)$^@#*&amp;! Grenade in my mouth, pull the #)$^@#*&amp;! pin, and I wouldn't feel a d@&amp;$ thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my X*$(@#^&amp;$ mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my X*$(@#^&amp;$ shirt. At least the during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.

____

CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILI

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.

JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good balanced chili, neither mild now hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.

FRANK: - - - - - Mama?- - - (Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report)."

“It’s easy,” his friend says. “Think nickel, nickel, quarter, dollar in your head. Wave your hips to left and right every nickel, pull back when you think quarter, then thrust forward at dollar. Nickel nickel, quarter dollar. And repeat.”


Ok, easy enough the virgin says and hangs up. 


He inserts himself into his girlfriend and begins motioning to the left and right- “nickel, nickel” then back- “quarter” and forward “dollar”


Nervous, he actually says out loud every time:

The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Man took the half a lemon and went away.

The next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Man took the half a lemon and went away.

The next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Man took the half a lemon and went away.

Now the Monk was becoming curious as to why the Man always wanted half a lemon, so he decided to ask the Man about it the next time he came. So as usual, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away.

The next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain, but he didn’t have good running shoes and the Man got away.

The Monk, very curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, went out and bought running shoes to prepare for the next time the man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. Just as the Monk was about to catch the Man, the Man reached a river and jumped in and swim across. The Monk didn’t know how to swim, so he had to turn back.

The Monk, even more curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, taught himself how to swim to prepare for the next time the Man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. When the Man reached the river, he jumped in and swam across. The Monk jumped in the river and swam across too. After swimming across the river, the Man ran up to a cliff and started to climb. The Monk didn’t know how to climb so he had to turn back.

The Monk, ever more curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, taught himself how to climb to prepare for the next time the Man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon. The Monk tried to ask the Man why he wanted half a lemon, but the Man took the half a lemon and ran away. So, the Monk started chasing the man down the mountain. When the Man reached the river, he jumped in and swam across. The Monk jumped in the river and swam across too. After swimming across the river, the Man ran up to a cliff and started to climb. The Monk climbed up the cliff right behind the man. Once the Man reached the top, he ran over to the wreckage of an airplane and locked himself in. The Monk didn’t know how to pick a lock so he had to turn back. 

The Monk, now extremely curious about why the man always wanted half a lemon, taught himself how to pick locks to prepare for the next time the Man came. And sure enough, the next week, on Wednesday, the Man came to visit the Monk. The Man said to the Monk, ""Father be good and give me half a lemon."" and the Monk was good and gave the Man half a lemon.

The Monk climbed up the cliff right behind the man. Once the Man reached the top, he ran over to the wreckage of an airplane and locked himself in. The Monk followed and picked the lock to let himself in.

Now that the Man couldn’t run away, the Monk asked the Man again, “Why do you always come on Wednesday and ask for half a lemon?” The Man replied, “Okay, I’ll tell you. But please, Father be good and don’t tell anyone.”

**And the Monk was good and never told anyone.**

 The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind.
 He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave. Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again. 


The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" 


The man says, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."" 


The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk."" 

The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray- haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks. 

""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."" 

The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door."" 

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...

And hovering above this river is a fly. And looking at this fly as a fish. And the fish is looking at this fly and thinking ""You know what? That fly drops 6 inches, i'm gonna go up there and get that fly, and i'm going to have myself a really nice meal. "" 

  The fish didn't realize that there was a bear looking at the fish looking at the fly. The bear is thinking ""You know what? That fly drops 6 inches, that fish gets that fly, i'm gonna go in there and get that fish and i'm going to have myself a really nice meal.""

  The bear didn't realize that there was a hunter eating the sandwich, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. The hunter is sitting there and he's looking at the fly and he's like ""You know what? That fly drops 6 inches, that fish gets that fly and that bear gets that fish, i'm going to put the sandwich down and get my gun and i'm gonna shoot that bear and have myself a really nice meal.""

  The hunter didn't realize that there was a mouse watching the sandwich in the hunters hand watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. The mouse is looking at the fly and was thinking ""You know what? That fly drops 6 inches, that fish gets that fly, and the bear gets the fish, and the hunter drops his sandwich and shoots the bear, i'm gonna jump on that sandwich and i'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.""

  The mouse didn't realize that there's a cat watching the mouse, watching the hunter, watching the bear, watching the fish, watching the fly. And that cat sitting there looking at that fly and it's like ""You know what? That fly drops 6 inches, that fish gets that fly, the bear gets the fish, the hunter drops its sandwich and shoots the bear, the mouse gets the sandwich, i'm gonna get that mouse and i'm gonna have myself a really nice meal.""

  And then all of a sudden, it happened. The fly dropped six inches, the fish got the fly, the bear got the fish, the hunter threw down his sandwich and shot the bear, the mouse jumped on the sandwich, but then it all went wrong. The cat went to jump on the mouse and missed and landed in the river, and got completely soaked. And i think that's something to be said for something you know? No matter where you are, what you are, what you're doing? When a fly drops six inches, a pussy is gonna get wet.﻿ "

Nester almost jumped when he heard the owner talking because he was too focused on the book. But with a grin on his face, he responded, 'the scarier the better.' 

The owner smiled for a bit but then became serious again, 'Good for you, but my friend, remember this, no matter what you do... no matter what happens... do not... i repeat... DO NOT look at the last page of the book... it will traumatize you forever...'

Nester nods then they proceed to the payment. The owner say it will be 5000$, and without asking too many questions, Nester hands him 50 bills of 100$. That's his salary for the past 3 months, but he wants to find out what's actually in the book.

The first thing he does after leaving the bookstore, it's running back home. He locks the door, then enters his room, closes the curtain, then opens his new book. 

And because of this curiosity, he immediately turned the book to the last page...
