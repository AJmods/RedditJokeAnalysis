For example, if you are a politician in Nordics, there are just a few things you need to do:

1- Go to work by bike, let people take your photo and talk about it on the Internet. Lots of people in Nordics go to work by bike but nobody takes their photo and says ""You won't believe in this! Today, I saw a lady on the street and she was going to work by bike. She is so humble, right?!""

2- Say things like ""I hate racism"" or ""I think racism might be useful for our country in some cases, not all, just some"" or ""Go back to your own fucking country you immigrants!"" based on the political party you are in. Don't mix them up, though. It would end your career.

If you are a politician in the Middle East, there is just one thing you need to do. Say that ""I am Muslim and I will teach all those infidels around the world how to behave towards us"".

Way back in the woods there is a lake, and flying above the lake is a fly. In the lake is a fish who sees the fly and thinks to himself 'in a minute that fly is going to drop, I'm going to jump up and get that fly, and I'm going to have myself something good to eat.'

On the bank of the lake is a bear, and the bear sees the fly, and he sees the fish, and he thinks to himself 'in a minute that fly is going to drop, that fish is going to jump up and eat that fly, so I'm going to grab that fish and have me something good to eat.'

On the opposite shore from the bear is a hunter, and he sees the fly. He sees the fish. He sees the bear. He thinks to himself 'in a minute that fly is going to drop, that fish is going to eat that fly, that bear is going to reach out and grab that fish, I'm gonna shoot that bear, and I'm going to have myself something good to eat.'

Then there was a mouse. The mouse sees the fly, the fish, the bear, the hunter, and a cheese sand which in the hunters pocket. The mouse thinks to himself 'that fly is gonna drop, the fish is gonna eat the fly, the bear is going to catch the fish, the hunter is going to shoot the bear, and when he does that cheese sandwich is going to fall out of his pocket, I'm gonna run over to that sandwich and have myself something good to eat.'

A cat was watching all of this and thought to itself 'in a minute that fly is going to drop, that fish is going to eat the fly, that bear is going to grab the fish, the hunter is gonna shoot the bear, the cheese sandwich is going to fall on the ground, the mouse is going to run for the sandwich, I am going to pounce on that mouse, and I am going to have myself something good to eat.'

Low and behold it all came to pass, the fly dropped, the fish jumped up and caught the fly, the bear reached out for the fish, the hunter shot the bear, the cheese sandwich hit the floor, the mouse ran for his sandwich, and the cat ran... jumped... and landed in the lake.

Do you want to know the morale of this tale?

When the fly drops, the pussy gets wet."
