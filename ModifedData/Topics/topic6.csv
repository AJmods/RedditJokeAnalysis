In response to a question, Angus Young told the interviewer a story about an old friend of his, named Weasel. Weasel loved violence and fighting, and he figured the best way to get his fix was to move to America and join the army to fight in Vietnam. Not even a year after shipping out, he was discharged due to PTSD caused by a friendly fire incident in which he was the only survivor. In addition to the PTSD, he also developed severe depression, and two very noticeable speech impediments. The first of said speech impediments manifests with him replacing swear words with random, three-letter nonsense words. ""shit"" became ""cuf"", ""damn"" became ""pik"", ""fuck"" became ""oot"", and so on. The second impediment comes in the form of placing a T in front of the name of any place, so ""America"" becomes ""Tamerica"", ""England"" becomes ""Tengland"", ""Iraq"" becomes ""Tiraq"", and so on. Tiraq in particular was very important to him, as he made frequent donations to poor people there, and going on mission trips to feed them because he felt so bad for the people in Tiraq. Last but not least, he had severe depression and self-hate issues. Due to this, he was constantly telling Angus that he doesn't blame him for hating him, and that he wanted him to write an album about how awful he was after he died. One night, after telling him this for the umpteenth time, he took his own life. In accordances with Weasel's wishes, Angus made the decision to write the album: **FOR THOSE ABOUT TIRAQ, WEASEL OOT YOU!**"

As the ravens mature, they will stake off on their own to find a mate, convening into groups only when large amounts of food are present-- a dead elk, for instance. 

We are able to attribute the reason ravens do leave these groups to being stressed out from large groups. Scientists have found that there are elevated levels of corticosterone in the stool of group living ravens compared to the stool of solo/monogamous ravens.

So in short, *Corvus corax* hormones-- mostly corticosterone-- denote bemoaning a more robust aloneness, but condone courting a consort, and forming a home to call ones own."

The second man comes back with ten grapes. The kidnapper says the same to the man with grapes. He is on his ninth grape and suddenly starts laughing and accidentally crushes the last grape.

The first man comes back with 5 apples, and before they let him go, they say he has to fit them all up his arse without making a sound, otherwise, they would kill him. He got two up there but made a sound putting the third one up and they killed him. He looked down on the tribal village from the heavens and saw the second man come back with 5 grapes. He watched him get told what to do and start putting them up his arse, without any difficulty. Just as the second man was putting the 4th grape in, he let out a laugh and got killed. The first man met up with him in the heavens and asked why he made a sound because he could've lived. Then the second man tells him that he saw the last man coming back with pineapples.

He found a messenger and sent the letter with him to give to his daughter. The messenger returned the next day and said the daughter was not there, even after an hour of waiting.

After reading it, he believed the contents would be very useful to the general public. He sent a copy of the letter and the story of how he came across it to the local newspaper company to get the letter published.

When the newspaper company heard the story, they decided to interview the messenger and wrote an article titled, ""Man Sends Dozens of Copies of the Same Letter to His Daughter Before Passing"" which talked about how dedicated of a father he was by sending the same letter over and over to his unreceptive daughter, while only briefly mentioning the contents of the letter.

They were untied and fast they go running into the deep forest.  Within 30 mins, Aron came back. He showed to the cannibals 10 apples, only to know the fruits he found should be shoved up his ass by himself. If he fails, his head will be crushed with a boulder immediately.

While walking to their campsite, they get lost and wind up in the middle of the jungle where a native tribe finds them. The three men are captured and taken back to the tribes site. 

Miraculously, one of the tribesmen speaks the same language as the three captured men. He translates for his chief. ""If you three want to get out of here alive, you are to each go into the jungle and find 10 of one type of fruit. None of you can come back with the same thing. Don't think we won't know if you try to run. Our tribe is big and spans this whole jungle."" 

Bob gets his ten fruit first and returns to the tribe site with them. 

""You are to shove all of these fruits up your ass. If you make any expression while doing this, we will kill you."" states the tribesman. 

Bob can't even get the first fruit up his ass even remotely before grimacing, so he is executed and dragged off. 

Rob, managing to find grapes somehow, gets back and is told the same thing by the tribesman. Straightfaced, he manages to get 9 grapes up his ass before laughing. 

Now in Heaven, Rob sees Bob. Bob bursting with frustration at Rob exclaims ""Why did you start laughing?! You had one grape left!"" 

Rob replies ""I saw Todd walking in with pineapples.""

The first man returns with 3 grapes. The cannibal says ""Now push them all up your butt without laughing"". The first man obliges, does it easily and is allowed to live.

The second man then appears over the hill, running back with 3 cherries he's found. The leader says the same ""Now push these 3 fruits up your butt without laughing"".

He didn't want people to think this new story was a sequel, or derivative in some way.  Legally, since he'd sold the rights to ""The Monkey"" years ago, he wasn't even sure if he *could* write an ape-based story without bumping into some kind of copyright violation.  
  
But the publishers argued that ""Stephen King"" had much better name recognition among fans.  And anyway, hadn't he already said that he had retired Richard Bachman as a pseudonym?  Using Richard to write a horror story about a gorilla would be foolish.  Throwing away money, really.  
  
Stephen King argued as best he could, but in the end the publishers' desire for more money won out, and Richard Bachman was not chosen to be the name under which the horror story about the gorilla would be written.

The tribe tells each of them that they’ll let them live if they each go find 10 fruits each, so the guys split up to go find some fruits.

The 1st guy comes back with apples and then the cannibal tribe tells him another part to the deal.

“You have to put all ten up your butt without making a noise or we’ll execute you.”

The man had no choice, so he starts putting the apples up his buy and gets to 4 before the pain is too much and he screams. The tribe executed him.

The 2nd guy comes back with berries. They tell him the same thing. He gets to 9 and is about to put the 10th in when he starts laughing hysterically. Executed.

The 1st and the 2nd guy are in the afterlife talking. The 1st says to the 2nd, “Why’d you laugh? You were so close?” And the  2nd guy says “Well, I saw the third and he had pineapples.”"
