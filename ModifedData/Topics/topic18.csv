The doctor asks the next patient by tapping on his hand that what it is. He says it’s my hand. The doctor says good and moves onto the next question and asks the patient by tapping on his wrist that what it is. The patient says it’s my knee. He fails the test too.

The third patient comes in and same procedure follows. Doctor taps on his hand and asks what is it. He says it’s my hand. Next, the doctor moves onto the wrist and asks what it is. Patient says it’s my wrist. The doctor then taps the arm and asks what is it. The patient says it’s my knee and he fails the test too.

The fourth patient answers the first three questions correctly and when asked about the elbow, he says it’s my knee and thus fails the test.

The fifth patient answers the first four questions correctly and when asked about the shoulder, he says it’s my knee and so he fails the test too.

Sixth patient comes in and the doctor asks the same questions in same order. This patient answers all the parts correctly from hand to the shoulder. The doctor is very impressed and is finally happy that someone is going to be discharged.

All the other patients are also surprised as to how he managed to pass the test. So they inquire from him that how he was able to pass the test. The sixth patient looks at them, smiles, then taps his brain and says “I used my knee.”"
