The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.


The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him.


After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.


After two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Cincinnati Bengals, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone."

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible.

The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him just like his parents and he refused to live with her. Then the judge suggested he live with his grandparents; the boy cried and said that they also beat him.

Now learning that violence was apparently a way of life for the family, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.

After conferring with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Cleveland Browns whom the boy firmly believed were incapable of beating anyone."

3. You can choose any product from any floor, but once you go up a floor you cannot come back to the previous floor.

So one day a group of friends decide to give this place a visit. Once they go into the first floor of the store, they are greeted with a sign that says:

WELCOME TO THE FIRST FLOOR: All the men here are average-looking and have no jobs.

The girls just laugh and proceed to the second floor.

WELCOME TO THE SECOND FLOOR: All the men here are good-looking and have decent paying jobs.

The girls go 'That's nice, but let's see what else they've got'. So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE THIRD FLOOR: All the men here are good-looking, have decent paying jobs and are excellent in bed.

'Now we're talking!' shout the girls in excitement. 'But we still have three more floors to go, let's see what else they've got' So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE FOURTH FLOOR: All the men here are extremely good-looking, have high-paying jobs so you won't have to work a day in your life, are excellent in bed and they absolutely love kids.

The girls cannot contain their excitement and have half a mind to go into this door but the idea of two more floors is just too enticing. So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE FIFTH FLOOR: All the men here are extremely good-looking, have high-paying jobs so you won't have to work a day in your life, are excellent in bed, they absolutely love kids, are super romantic and they will never be unfaithful.

Now the girls are just absolutely squealing and are about to go thru this door when they remember there's still one more floor. 'What could be better than this? Remember we can't ever come back if we leave' they think. But curiosity gets the best from them. So they proceed to the next floor.

WELCOME TO THE SIXTH FLOOR: There are no men here. This floor is here just as proof that women are impossible to please. You are the 31,428,474th visitor of this floor. Thank you for shopping with us!

BONUS:

They opened a Wife Store next door with the same rules:

Then a man walks out on the balcony and I start begging him to help. Instead he starts kicking and beating me, but I hold on. 

He gets a hammer and smashes my fingers and I end up falling 10 floors into some bushes. Im laying there amazed at being alive when a refridgerator lands on me... and here I am!

St Peters mutters something and lets him into heaven.

The third guy walks up:

""Picture this... Im Hiding.... in a refridgerator......""

""Oh boy"" Says the fly ""If I drop just six inches I'll be able to feel the cooling mist of the river and take a break!""

However, little does the fly know that there is a fish hiding just beneath the water. The fish thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops just six inches, I'll be able to jump up and eat the fly!""

Unbeknownst to the fish, there is a bear hiding in the bushes by the bank of the river. He sees the fly and the fish and thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops six inches then the fish will jump for the fly, and then I can run out and catch the fish!""

Hidden from the bear up in a treestand, is a hunter. He sees the fly, the fish and the bear just poking out of the bushes and he thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops six inches, the fish will jump for the fly, the bear will run to catch the fish, and then I can get a shot at the bear!""

There's a sandwich in the hunter's pocket, but it's hanging precariously in such a way that a mouse, cowering behind the hunter thinks to himself ""Oh boy, if that fly drops six inches, the fish will jump for the fly, the bear will run for the fish, the hunter will lean forward to shoot the bear, the sandwich will fall out of his pocket and then I can eat the sandwich!""

Above the mouse, higher in the tree is a cat. He spies the fly, the fish, the bear, the hunter, the sandwich and the mouse and thinks to himself ""Oh boy, this is purrrfect. If that fly drops six inches then the fish will jump for the fly, the bear will run to catch the fish, the hunter will lean forward to shoot the bear, the sandwich will fall out of his pocket, the mouse will come out into the open to grab the sandwich and then I'll be free to pounce on the mouse!"" 

SO!

The fly decides to go for it, he drops six inches to feel the mist of the river. The fish leaps out of the water to nab the fly, the bear barrels out of the bushes to grab the fish, the hunter leans forward and pulls the trigger causing the sandwich to fall out of his pocket, the mouse rushes out to nibble at the sandwich and the cat, startled by the gunshot, jumps, misses and then falls into the river...

Now what's the moral of the story?



If the fly drops 6 inches, the pussy gets wet. "

So, I cut off one of its front legs. Then I said: ""frog, jump!""
And the frog jumped. It was at a slight angle, but it wasn't too bad.

Then I cut off its second front leg and told it to jump. It jumped quite weirdly, but that was to be expected now that it only had two back legs.

I cut off one of its back legs and said: ""frog, jump."" and the frog jumped very badly, just barely managing to get off the ground.

Finally, I cut off its last leg and told it to jump. It did not move at all. No matter how many times I told it to jump, it did not.

So, I concluded that when you cut off all of a frogs legs, they go deaf.

But what the bear doesn't notice is there is a hunter with a sandwich watching the bear watching the fish which is watching the fly

So the hunter thinks to himself ""if that fly drops 6 inches , the fish will get the fly , the bear will get the fish and I'll shoot the bear and then I'll have a good meal""

'You talk?' he asks.

'Yep,' the Lab replies.¬†

The Lab looks up and says, 'Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young.  I wanted to help the government, so... I told the CIA.  In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.'¬†

'I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running...

But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.'
