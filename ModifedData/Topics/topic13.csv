Used by US Federal Aviation Administration, it's a unique device for testing the strength of windshields on airplanes. The device is a gun that launches a dead chicken at a plane’s windshield at approximately the speed the plane flies.

&amp;#x200B;

The theory is that if the windshield doesn’t crack from the carcass impact, it’ll survive a real collision with a bird during flight.

&amp;#x200B;

Hearing about the chicken cannon, the British were very interested in this and wanted to test a windshield on their brand new, speedy locomotive they’re developing.

&amp;#x200B;

They borrowed FAA’s chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired.

&amp;#x200B;

The ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, broke the engineer’s  chair and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine’s cab.   They did the test the second time with the same result..

&amp;#x200B;

The British were stunned and asked the FAA to send a technician recheck the test to see if  everything was done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

The FAA technician arrived and reviewed the test thoroughly, ""Hmmm, I see.. and ok.  Let's do the test again boys but this time, let's use a thawed chicken.”"

Have fun, but take your time."" The farmer points him toward the henhouse and the rooster takes off like a shot.

WHAM! Randy nails every hen in the henhouse, three or four times. Randy runs out and sees a flock of geese down by the lake. WHAM! He nails all the geese. Randy runs to the pigpen, the cow pasture -- soon, he's been on every animal on the farm.

The farmer is distraught, worried that his expensive rooster won't even last the day.

Sure enough, the farmer wakes up the next morning to find Randy laid out flat in the middle of the yard, buzzards circling overhead.

The sad farmer shakes his head and says, ""Oh, Randy, I told you to pace yourself.""

Randy opens one eye, winks, and nods towards the sky, ""Shhh, they're getting closer."""
