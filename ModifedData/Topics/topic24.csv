The project was in its infancy and Bob was tasked with gathering up materials, mostly from other engineering groups who’d completed products in the past. The facility had manufactured many products over the years with various codenames, the “Rep OS”, the well-liked “Desc VT”, but far and away the most popular was the ubiquitous “Rep OST”.

Bob knew that topping the Rep OST would be quite the challenge but he was determined to make it happen. Bob took the elevator down to a couple levels to Sub Floor J where he hoped to source some of the resources he needed. He inquired with a technician who replied “You’re working on that new product, huh? Well we’re no help to you. This sub doesn’t have any Origin AL material, just a bunch of Rep OSTs.”"
