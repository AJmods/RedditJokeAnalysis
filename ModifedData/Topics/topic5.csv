With so many people currently staying at home, one profession has been hit the hardest: the burglar. The once lucrative craft is now in serious peril, and we must protect these hard working men and women. I propose that we provide free housing and food to them during this period of economic strife. We need to step up a place in each town and city for them to apply for this aid. I suggest the local police department because every town already has one and logistically it just makes sense. All the unfortunate craftsperson needs to do is go to the police station and fill out a few papers showing that they are in fact in the affected trade. Then the police could escort them to their new free housing."

But the water is also in touch with the glass. water has to always be in contact with something. so lets say u have water. where do u have ur water? in the spring? ok so the spring is wet. but in order to make the spring wet, you need the water touching the spring to make it wet. however this also means the spring is touching the water. the water cant touch the spring without the spring touching the water. so if the water makes the spring wet then the spring also makes the water wet, because they are in touch with eachother. so maybe u are now thinking. what if i got water and i throw it up in the air where it isnt touching anything at all. now its just water and the water isnt wet. i guess u are maybe right but it depends how far u are willing to go with this. there is no nothing. in the air there is o2 and other particles i do not know of, but there is no nothing ever around. always some sort of atoms and whatnot. so that means the water is touching these atoms/particles/whatever, meaning the water is always in contact with something, always making something wet. and if its always making stuff wet, then water HAS TO BE IN FACT WET. its like if something stinks. the stink will always be there, until u take a shower. so lets say u never shower for rest of of ur life. then it means u are stinking 100% of the time. just like water is wet 100% of the time. Also, lets say u splash some water on your shirt. now your tshirt is wet. right? how did it become wet? from water. but you say water isnt wet? ok let me throw some dirt on your shirt. is it now wet? no it isnt, because there is no water, only dirt. but u say water isnt wet cause water itself isnt wet, its just water. but as ive mentioned water is 100% of the time in touch with something, be it the spring, in ur glass or on ur shirt or in the air. its always in touch with something, making water being wet 100% of the time, meaning that water is in fact wet. conclusion: water is wet"

In the lake, there is a fish. The fish sees the fly and says to itself, ""If that fly were to come down about 4 inches, I could jump up and eat him!""

By the lake there is a bear. The bear sees the fly and the bear sees the fish and says to itself, ""If that fly were to come down about 4 inches, the fish would jump up and eat him, and while the fish was in the air, I could catch it and eat it!""

Off in the woods by the bear, there is a hunter. The hunter sees the fly, and the fish, and the bear, and says to himself, ""If that fly were to come down about 4 inches, the fish would jump up and eat him, the bear would get the fish, and while the bear is eating, I can shoot the bear!""

Next to the hunter are some crackers and a mouse hiding in a bush. The mouse sees the fly, and the fish, and the bear, and the hunter, and the crackers and says to herself, ""If that fly were to come down about 4 inches, the fish would get the fly, the bear would get the fish, the hunter would get the bear, and while the hunter is skinning the bear, I can eat those delicious crackers!""

Up in a tree there is a cat. The cat sees the fly, and the fish, and the bear, and the hunter, and the crackers, and the mouse, and says to itself, ""If that fly were to come down about 4 inches, the fish would get the fly, the bear would get the fish, the hunter would get the bear, the mouse would get her crackers, and while she is eating them, I can get the mouse!""

Well that fly finally came down about 4 inches, and you know what happened? 

The fish got the fly, the bear got the fish, the hunter got the bear, the mouse got her crackers, but when the cat tried to get the mouse, it fell in the lake!

The moral of the story is: when the fly comes down, the pussy gets wet."
