I talked about staying in school, getting good grades and all that usual bullshit; and since I had plenty of time because those other guys didn't show, I threw it open for questions. The last one asked was, ""Can you give us a couple of your life's philosophical beliefs?""

I said, ""That's an easy one. Looking back over my lifetime, I've spent most of my money  on guns, airplanes, fast cars, women and whiskey.  The rest I just wasted.""

I was escorted out without getting to finish my last two rules to live by:

1) If it flies, floats, or fucks, it's cheaper to rent it.

2) If it's got tits or tires, you're gonna have problems with it.

I’ve always just assumed a prison wallet was for men in prison only.

But I was thinking the other day, women inmates actually have two prison wallets.   Well, actually, they have a prison wallet and a prison purse.

When using them, I guess they need to make the decision to store their valuables in the purse or the wallet.

Unlike a normal, non-prison wallet &amp; purse, you can’t put the wallet inside the purse.  Well maybe you can, I've never been to prison.

""What a feat!"" said the Emperor. ""Number Two Samurai, show me what you do.""


The Chinese samurai smiled confidently, stepped forward and opened a tiny box, releasing a fly. He drew his samurai sword and *Swish! *Swish!* The fly fell to the floor neatly quartered.

The Jewish samurai, Yoku Cohen, stepped forward, opened a tiny box releasing one fly, drew his samurai sword and *Swoosh!* flourished his sword mightily, but the fly was still buzzing around!


In disappointment, the Emperor said, ""What kind of skill is that?? The fly isn't even dead.""
