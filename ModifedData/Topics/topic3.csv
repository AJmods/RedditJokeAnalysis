As he barman places the beers on the counter he glances at the beast lying at the Aussie's feet.  The barman raises one eyebrow and says ""That is surely the ugliest dog I've ever seen in my life. What sort of breed is it?""

The Aussie takes a long swig of his beer, puts down the glass, and says: ""He is a long-nosed, short-eared, long-bodied, short-legged water-hound, and I'll have you know that he's the best darn fighter I've ever owned!""

The barman takes another long look and laughs. ""I happen to own the toughest bulldog in the whole shire, and he's never been beaten in a fight. I'll wager $1000 that my dog could beat that ugly mutt of yours any day of the week.""

The Aussie takes the barman up on the bet and they bundle the two unfortunate creatures unceremoniously into the back room of the pub and pull the door shut. Immediately there is a frenzy of snarls, growls and yelps, followed by an eerie silence. 

Grinning, the barman opens the door, keen to collect on his $1000 wager. To his dismay, his bulldog is lying dead in a pool of blood whilst the Aussie's four-legged companion lays in the middle of the room, casually chewing on the remains of the bulldog's left rear leg.

The barman shakes his head as he reaches into his back pocket and hands over a large roll of bank notes.  ""17 fights..."", he mutters, ""17 fights my dog has been in and he's never lost a single one until now. Who ever knew that such an odd-looking mutt as yours would be able to fight so well. What sort of breed did you say he was again?""

The bartender says, ""Okay, but it had better be good.""
The man reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a hamster. He sets the hamster down on the bar. It scurries about, jumps off the end, turns a perfect somersault in midair, and lands on the piano. He then begins to dance across the keys, playing the piano beautifully. The bartender says, ""Wow! That was truly incredible! Have a beer.""
The man finishes his beer and says to the bartender, ""Hey, if I show you something else that is so amazing I can guarantee you've never seen before, will you give me another free beer?""
""If it's as amazing as that hamster, then sure,"" the bartender replies.
So the man reaches into his other coat pocket and pulls out a frog. He sets the frog down on the bar, and the frog begins to sing beautifully. The bartender is again amazed, and the man earns another beer.
As the man is drinking his beer, a guy at the other end of the bar walks over and says, ""What a performer! I'll give you $500 for that frog.""
The first man says, ""It’s a deal!"" and sells the guy his frog. The bartender shakes his head slowly. ""Not that it's any of my business, mind you, but that was a real, live singing frog. Why would you sell it for only $500? You could have made millions off of it.""

A regular walks in, says “Give me a jack and coke please.”

The bartender puts an apple on the counter in front of him.

“Are you deaf? I wanted a jack and coke!”

The bartender says “please sir, just bite the apple.”

He takes a bite and to his amazement the apple tastes just like Jack Daniels. 

“Now turn it around”, says the bartender.

He turns the apple around and the other side tastes like coke. The customer is speechless.

Another guy comes up to the bar and wants a gin and tonic. Again, the bartender pulls out an apple and puts it on the bar. 

Again, the customer takes a bite of the apple and it tastes just like gin! He flips the apple over and takes a bite and it tastes like tonic! 

It’s around closing time now and a stranger walks in. He sits quietly at the bar. The first guy, already drunk at this point, turns to the stranger.

“This bartender is incredible. He can make an apple taste like anything you want!”

“Anything I want, huh? Okay, bartender, make me one that tastes like pussy!”

He immediately puts an apple in front of the guy. He takes a bite and spits it right out.

“Man this apple tastes like shit!”

If the fish could play the piano, he would get a free drink. The barman agreed, and the man went over to the piano. He took the fish out, which promptly played the most amazing music. Everyone in the bar went silent, and when the fish had finished most of them were in tears. The man went over to the barman which was amazed! He gave him his free drink, and when he had finished, the man says to the barman that he also has a frog which can sing magnificent songs. He again wagers the barman that if his frog can sing, he can have free drink. He then takes a frog out of his pocket, puts it on a stool, and the frog starts to sing. The song is marvellous, and everyone in the bar again stops and listens to the song. And again, the man walks over to the barman for his drink. But before he can reach the bar, a man approaches him offering to buy the frog for £500. The barman shouts out in horror that he could make millions from the frog, and its worth at least a thousand times that. The man ignores him and sells the frog. He walks over to the bar with his money and starts to drink his drink. The barman-in shock-asks him why he sold the frog for such little money! The man replied ""The fish is a ventriloquist""."
