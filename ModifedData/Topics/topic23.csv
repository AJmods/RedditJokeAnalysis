85,000 people jammed into Sanford Stadium. National television audience. This game is on the Armed Service Network. People in Switzerland are seeing this ballgame. Going everywhere.  
The band cranks up “Glory, Glory to Ole Georgia” and our team comes running out. 85,000 stand as one.  
We are led by our gallant mascot, UGA-U-G-A. What a dog! What a gorgeous dog. What a symbol of ferocity. But UGA ain’t real smart. UGA did not realize he was at a football game. Nor did he realize he was on national television, and was going into living rooms the width and breadth of this great nation.  
And there, in front of all them people, he began to lick himself where dogs occasionally want to lick themselves, ok?  
We don’t have to get any more graphic than that.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a seven with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the seven will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of a number that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that the only thing they eat has almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.
Because it holds such little nutritional value, sevens have to ferment it in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal."

Terrorists have been re-categorized from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the English issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from ""Pissed Off"" to ""Let's Get the Bastards."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from ""Run"" to ""Hide."" The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""

The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbour"" and ""Lose.""

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from ""No worries"" to ""She'll be alright, Mate."" Two more escalation levels remain: ""Crikey!
