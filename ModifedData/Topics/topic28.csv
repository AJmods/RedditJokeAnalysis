One day he drove the train to fast and it derailed, killing a passenger. 

He went to court and he was sentenced to death for manslaughter. 

When he was asked his last meal he said he wanted a banana. It was given to him

He was put on the electric chair and they turned it on but...... nothing happened and the man was still alive

By law, if you are not killed in the electric chair it is a sign from god and you are let free.

So the man was let free and somehow he got his old job back

But, just like before, he drove the train to fast and it derailed. This time it killed 2 people.

Again he was sentenced to death and for his last meal he asked for 2 bananas. He was brought to the chair and zapped but still nothing.

Again he was let free and somehow got his old job back. This time he was driving so fast it killed 3 people when it derailed. 

He was again, sentenced to death. This time asking for 3 bananas. But this time the executioner said “ NO! I’m not giving you your stupid bananas” 

He turned on the electric chair but still nothing happened. 

The executioner said “ WHAT?!? How are you still alive??!?”
