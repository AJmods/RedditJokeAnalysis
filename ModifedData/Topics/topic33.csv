Men should take a concerned look at their beer consumption.

The theory is that beer contains female hormones (hops contain phytoestrogens) and that by drinking enough beer, men turn into women.

To test the theory, 100 men drank 8 pints of beer each within a 1 hour period.

It was then observed that all of the test subjects:

1. Argued over nothing
2. Refused to apologize when obviously wrong
3. Gained weight
4. Talked excessively without making sense
5. Became overly emotional
6. Couldn't drive
7. Failed to think rationally
8. Had to sit down while urinating

In those days it took a  lot of guts to walk into the drug store and ask for condoms because  everyone knew everyone else.

Mary, the girl behind the counter,  was almost 20 and knew what they were for. She could see that I was  really embarrassed because I turned red and started stuttering.

When Mary handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one, I said ‘No, not really.'

So she unwrapped the package, took one out, and slipped it over her  thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure.

Mary could tell that I was still confused, so she looked all around the  store to see if there were any other customers. Then she said 'Just a  minute,' and walked me into the storage room. Then Mary took off her  blouse and bra and said ‘Do these excite you?'

Well, I was so  dumb-struck that all I could do was stand there with my mouth open and  nod my head. Mary told me to put the condom on, and then she dropped her  skirt, took off her panties and laid down on a desk.

'Well, come  on', Mary said, 'We don't have much time.' So I climbed on her and it  felt so incredible that I couldn’t hold back and KAPOW, I was done in  less than a minute.

Mary looked at me with a big frown and said,  'Did you put that condom on?' she asked. I said, 'sure did,' and held up  my thumb to show her.

Then she beat the shit out of me....

She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.

‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.

‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.

I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.
