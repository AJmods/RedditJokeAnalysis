Due to the government shutdown, federal employees and contractors at the secretive Area 51 military base have been furrowed.  
Because of this, captured aliens from the Tau Ceti star system have been free to roam the base, and some have escaped into the general population of Nevada.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been unable to arrest these illegal aliens because ICE only has authority over humans.  
The Fish And Wildlife Service is also powerless, as the aliens are not terrestrial animals. Likewise, the Department Of Homeland Security and the State Department are also powerless.

One group of undocumented aliens has opened a Taco stand in Taos, New Mexico. According to local residents the Tacos have otherworldly ingredients not regulated by the FDA.

In the town of Rachel, Nevada, local residents are complaining about the aliens taking their jobs.  
“I’ve been a pipe fitter for 30 years” says citizen Heywood Jablowme, “But these creatures from space come it and use their technology to put me out of business. I can’t compete.”

Even high tech workers in Las Vegas have been affected. Citizen Crystal Mheth was a computer coder until the company she worked for hired one of the Tau Ceti aliens. “This… thing… from another world came in and updated our technology by 1000 years. I can’t even comprehend their quantum programming language” she said.

Some have accused the locals of racism.  
Amanda Huginkiss of the NAACP says “Judging these folks is the worst kind of racism. Just because they have a completely different biology than anything else on the planet is no excuse to treat them differently.”

We asked on of the Tau Ceti aliens for a comment. It said “A’klyFnm USfgY Ph’JUi H%fWikOlDs’GSt sQv’dckC#psRxz!”

A young guy called Tommy bought a horse from a farmer for $250 and the farmer agreed to deliver the horse to Tommy the following day.

The next day though, the farmer turned up at Tommy’s house and said, “Sorry son, but I have some bad news, the horse died.”

Tommy replied, “Well, then just give me my money back. That’s fine.”

The farmer said, “Sorry, I can’t do that. I went and spent it already.”

Tommy then said, “Okay, then, just bring me the dead horse.”

The farmer was surprised and asked Tommy, “Why? What ya gonna do with him?”

Tommy replied, “I’m going to raffle him off.”

The farmer laughed and said, “You can’t raffle off a dead horse! Who’d buy a ticket?”

Tommy answered, “Sure I can, just watch me. I just won’t tell anybody the horse is dead.”

A month later, the farmer met up with Tommy again and asked, “What happened with that dead horse in the end. Did you raffle him off?”

Tommy said, “I sure did. I sold 500 tickets at $5 a piece.”

The farmer said, “Didn’t anyone complain?”

Tommy smiled and said, “Just the guy who won. So I gave him his $5 back.”"
