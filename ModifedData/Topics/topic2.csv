However with that being said what it highlights is the endless distribution and importing of eggs all around the world. Rising fear of egg presence all around Australia and new Zealand. The real cause of what happened today was Australian government allowing to import and to produce eggs in their country in the first place. While today the senator is the victim it doesn't make him the blameless. If you banned eggs in the first place it would have been avoided.

His parents loved him too, so they let him have his dream job, a conductor. He would spend all day and all night looking at trains. He was 18 and he needed a job. He saw that his dream job was hiring, so he applied to conductor school. He learned all about everything in a train. He studied day and night to pass the final exams. He had studied for a full day straight, and went to take the test. He finished the test in an hour, the fastest it has ever been completed. The next week he got his test back. He had failed. All his hopes and dreams were gone, so he went to his teacher and asked her how he could become a conductor. She said he could retake the test next year. So the boy studied and studied day and night just to pass the test. It was exam day, and he took the test. He set the record again for completing the test in an astonishing 45 minutes. He failed. He became really depressed and he asked the teacher again. His hopes quickly ignited when he heard her say he could retake it one last time next year. The boy studied and studied for as long as he could. It was time to take the test again. He managed to break the record again completing it in 30 minutes. The next week, he failed. He was so depressed. When he left, he saw a train parked at a station. He quickly jumped into the control room and started to drive again. He crashed the train and everybody but him died. He was arrested and was sentenced to the death penalty. The guard at the prison asked him what he wanted for his last meal before he was executed. He said he wanted the copper apple from the depths of the Amazon river. The prison sent out the best explorers to find the apple. They brought it back to him, and he ate it. He said, ""Wow! This is the best apple I have ever had!"" It was time for his execution. They strapped him into the chair and pulled the switch. Nothing happened. They raised the power, and still nothing happened. They told him he would be executed another day. They day of his execution, he asked for the jade apple of the depths of the Gobi desert. The same explorers went to find the apple, and they found it. They gave it to him and he ate it. He again loved the apple so much. They strapped him in again and flipped the switch. Nothing happened. They told him they would do it tomorrow and he asked for the crystal apple from the sewers of NYC. The explorers found the apple and gave it to him. He said it was the best apple he had ever had and there was no way of changing that. They strapped him in once again and flipped the switch. It was at it's highest capacity. Once again, nothing.

He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.


The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

A man was stranded out at sea, near death, when he sees a boat come up to save him... The captain said “get on”, but the guy refused saying “I know with Gods will, he will save me. I do not need help from you, I have God”. The captain went on without the man........ 

Soon after a different boat came up, in a similar fashion. The captain also offered help, yet the guy refused, stating “God will save me, I do not need you!” The captain went on...

Lastly there was a third boat came up, but the same thing happened again... Soon after the third boat left, the man drowned... 

He went to heaven, and met God. He asked God “why didn’t you save me?” God replied “I sent you 3 boats you dummy”... The man symbolizes stubborn Christians, and the stay-at-home order symbolizes the boats."

Unfortunately, the book was a marketplace failure, and the research team wound up with hundreds, if not thousands, of unsold copies.
